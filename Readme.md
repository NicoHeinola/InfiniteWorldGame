# A prototype of an infinite 2D world made with Unity
## About
This is a prototype where I experimented with infinite worlds and chunk-loading in Unity. The chunk-loading and infinite system was designed and built by mostly by me and uses threading to improve performance. The game also has collision, damage, levels, hp and such. I also built a simple enemy spawning and despawning systems. They also target the player if he gets too close and start to follow him.
